            <p>I installed the app and went for a free consultation with a dietician. The advice given by Dr. Mirza was simply great. He shared a detailed diet chart and exercises with me which was easy to fit into my hectic schedule.</p>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>When will I get an answer to my query? What happens if I don’t get a response?</h4>
        <p>If you opt for a free consult, then we make sure the doctor replies within 24 to 48 hours. In case of a paid consult, you will receive a reply within 2-4 business hours. However, if you do not get any response within the stipulated time, we will refund your money back into your account.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Who are the consulting doctors?</h4>
        <p>All the doctors are registered medical practitioners. Along with qualifying degrees - experience, research and track-record of practice are taken into account before a doctor is credentialed with Tata 1mg and is given access to answer patient queries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Will the doctor be able to resolve my issue?</h4>
        <p>Our doctors will give you expert advice on your problem and help you identify next steps which may include further tests, medicine recommendation or lifestyle tips. Few cases require face-to-face examination and we ask patients to share pictures or reports if they can, for a conclusive diagnosis.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Do you have a “refund” policy?</h4>
